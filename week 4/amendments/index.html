1. Congress shall make no law 
respecting an establishment of religion, 
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; 
or abridging the freedom of speech, 
or of the press; or the right of the 
people peaceably to assemble, 
and to petition the Government 
for a redress of grievances.


The First Amendment prohibits the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion, 
impeding the free exercise of religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing 
on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or 
prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances. Initially, 
the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by Congress, and many of 
its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today.

2. A well regulated Militia, 
being necessary to the 
security of a free State, the right of 
the people to keep and bear Arms, 
shall not be infringed.


The Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms. 
The concept of a right to keep and bear arms existed within English 
common law long before the enactment of the Bill of Rights.

3. No Soldier shall, in time of peace 
be quartered in any house, without the 
consent of the Owner, nor in time of
war, but in a manner to be 
prescribed by law.

The Third Amendment restricts the quartering of soldiers in private homes, in response to Quartering Acts 
passed by the British parliament during the Revolutionary War. The amendment is one of the least 
controversial of the Constitution, and, as of 2012, has never been the primary basis of a Supreme Court decision.

4. The right of the people to be 
secure in their persons, houses, 
papers, and effects, against 
unreasonable searches and seizures, 
shall not be violated, and no Warrants 
shall issue, but upon probable 
cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, 
and particularly describing the place to 
be searched, and the persons or 
things to be seized. 

The Fourth Amendment guards against unreasonable searches and seizures, 
along with requiring any warrant to be judicially sanctioned and supported by 
probable cause. It was adopted as a response to the abuse of the 
writ of assistance, which is a type of general search warrant, in 
the American Revolution. Search and seizure (including arrest) must be 
limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court, 
usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it. The amendment 
is the basis for the exclusionary rule, which mandates that evidence obtained 
illegally cannot be introduced into a criminal trial.[90] The amendment's 
interpretation has varied over time; its protections expanded under 
left-leaning courts such as that headed by Earl Warren and contracted 
under right-leaning courts such as that of William Rehnquist.

5. No person shall be held to 
answer for a 
capital, or otherwise infamous 
crime, unless 
on a presentment or indictment of a 
Grand Jury, except in cases arising 
in the land or naval forces, 
or in the Militia, when in actual 
service in time 
of War or public danger; 
nor shall any person be 
subject for the same offence 
to be twice put in 
jeopardy of life or limb; 
nor shall be compelled 
in any criminal case to be a 
witness against 
himself, nor be deprived of 
life, liberty, or 
property, without due process 
of law; nor shall 
private property be taken for public use, 
without just compensation.


The Fifth Amendment protects against double jeopardy and self-incrimination 
and guarantees the rights to due process, grand jury screening of criminal 
indictments, and compensation for the seizure of private property under 
eminent domain. The amendment was the basis for the court's decision 
in Miranda v. Arizona (1966), which established that defendants 
must be informed of their rights to an attorney and against 
self-incrimination prior to interrogation by police.

6. In all criminal prosecutions, the 
accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy 
and public trial, by an impartial 
jury of the State and district 
wherein the crime shall have been 
committed, which district shall 
have been previously ascertained 
by law, and to be informed of 
the nature and cause of the 
accusation; to be confronted 
with the witnesses against him; 
to have compulsory process for obtaining 
witnesses in his favor, and to have the 
Assistance of Counsel for his defence.



-- The right to a speedy and public trial
-- The right to trial by an impartial jury
-- The right to be informed of criminal charges
-- The right to confront witnesses
-- The right to compel witnesses to appear in court
-- The right to assistance of counsel[93]

7. In suits at common law, where the 
value in controversy shall exceed twenty 
dollars, the right of trial by jury shall 
be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, 
shall be otherwise re-examined in any court 
of the United States, than according to the 
rules of the common law.


 The Seventh Amendment guarantees jury trials in federal civil cases 
 that deal with claims of more than twenty dollars. It also prohibits 
 judges from overruling findings of fact by juries in federal civil trials. 
 In Colgrove v. Battin (1973), the Court ruled that the amendment's 
 requirements could be fulfilled by a jury with a minimum of six members. 
 The Seventh is one of the few parts of the Bill of Rights not 
 to be incorporated (applied to the states).

8. Excessive bail shall not be required, nor 
excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and
unusual punishments inflicted.


The Eighth Amendment forbids the imposition of excessive bails or fines, though it leaves the term "excessive" open to interpretation.

The most frequently litigated clause of the amendment is the last, which forbids cruel and unusual punishment.[96][97] This clause was only occasionally applied by the Supreme Court prior to the 1970s, generally in cases dealing with means of execution. In Furman v. Georgia (1972), some members of the Court found capital punishment itself in violation of the amendment, arguing that the clause could reflect "evolving standards of decency" as public opinion changed; others found certain practices in capital trials to be unacceptably arbitrary, resulting in a majority decision that effectively halted executions in the United States for several years.[98] Executions resumed following Gregg v. Georgia (1976), which found capital punishment to be constitutional if the jury was directed by concrete sentencing guidelines.[98] The Court has also found that some poor prison conditions constitute cruel and unusual punishment, as in Estelle v. Gamble (1976)

9. The enumeration in the Constitution, 
of certain rights, 
shall not be construed to deny 
or disparage others 
retained by the people.[75]
 
The Ninth Amendment clarifies that the specific individual rights 
stated in the Constitution, particularly in the Bill of Rights, 
does not constitute an explicit and exhaustive listing of all individual rights 
possessed by the people, and cannot be 
used by the federal government to increase its powers in areas 
not stated. It was rarely cited before the second half of the 20th 
century, when it was used as a positive affirmation of a right not 
stated but nonetheless protected by the Constitution,[99] the right to 
privacy. This right was, in turn, the foundation upon which the Supreme 
Court built decisions in several landmark cases: Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), 
which struck down a Connecticut law criminalizing the use of contraceptives; Roe v. Wade (1973), 
which overturned a Texas law making it a crime to assist a woman to get an abortion; 
and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), which invalidated a Pennsylvania 
law that required spousal awareness prior to obtaining an abortion.

10. The powers not delegated to the 
United States by the Constitution, 
nor prohibited by it to the 
States, are reserved to the States 
respectively, or to the people. 


The Tenth Amendment reinforces the principles of separation 
of powers and federalism by providing that powers not granted 
to the federal government by the Constitution, nor prohibited to 
the states, are reserved to the states or the people. 
The amendment provides no new powers or rights to the states, 
but rather preserves their authority in all matters not 
specifically granted to the federal government.
